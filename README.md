# ExhaustAndHeaterControllV2.3

Used ArduinoIDE and VSCode with Arduino Extension
Used below libraries
1. DHT sensor library by Adafruit Version 1.4.1    // Note yet tested latest library version 1.4.4 
2. LiquidCrystal by Arduino version 1.0.7
3. Wire library default with ArduinoIDE for I2C communication

Note: I used Arduino pro mini 5V version but may be for future project I would like to used NodeMCU so that
IoT application can be explore and developped to controll and change timing from online open source IoT platform
as well as record data for temperuture humidity and dewpoint. Also record Exhaust fans and heater ON and OFF time to 
calculate power consumption.
